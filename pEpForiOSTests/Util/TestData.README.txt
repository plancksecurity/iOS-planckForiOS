= What this is = 

The TestData class can be used to test SMTP and IMAP
connections and its operations with (unit) test 
accounts.

In a private held copy specific settings for this (including
credentials) can be made.

= How to use it = 

Create a copy of TestData.swift.sample as TestData.swift
to omit Xcode errors when building and populate it with 
corresponding (valid) settings to run successful tests.

See the TestData.swift.sample file for examples on the
values allowed (and expected).

= What to ensure =

Please do not add your own copy of TestData.swift to
the repository, i. e. do not leak settings and
specifically credentials to the public.

TestData.swift.sample is the the only bare piece 
of the the TestData class to stay published: no other
than structural changes are to be made to it.
