    /// ================================
    /// The controller caches the results unless `cacheName` is explicitly set to nil. If you do
    /// not provide a `cacheName`, a name is generated according to the name of the caller of init.
    /// If the same client code initializes the QueryResultsController multiple times the
    /// generated cache name will stay the same and thus the cache will be maintained across
    /// launches of your application.
    ///

    ///   - cacheName: Name of cache.
