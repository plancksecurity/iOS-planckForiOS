/// Logs messages to console and a log file that can also be retrieved from this logger.
/// Several log levels are offered. See the docs of the several methods for details.
///
/// The log file is written in the App Group with identifier `group.security.pep.pep4ios`.
/// The log file is replaced with an empty one whenever it reaches max file size.
///
/// Two logging modes are available: normal & verbose.
///
/// Usage Swift: You MUST use the Singleton Logger.shared.
///
/// Usage ObjC: Use the marcos defined in `PEPLogger/PEPLogger.h`.
