Additionally to such data, You agree that there is technical, statistical and usage data collected and stored by the web system of pEp Security SA and the shop systems of pEp Security SA or third party, where products of pEp Security SA are described and deployed. For all data pEp Security SA has stored about You, pEp Security SA is intending not to violate privacy at all, and therefore never is profiling single people or storing any unneeded personal data. You have the right for receiving a copy of all personal data pEp Security SA is storing about You. Furthermore, you have the right to decide that pEp Security SA must delete all personal data about You, except such data, which pEp Security SA is legally bound to store (like invoice data for bookkeeping et.al.). pEp Security SA never sells personal data about you to third party, like address dealers.</span></span></span></span></p>
